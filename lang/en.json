  "start": "We find ourselves at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, in the heart of the Italian Renaissance. A period in which the peninsula is largely fragmented into a multitude of duchies, lordships, kingdoms and republics in constant competition with each other. Dominating the political scene are the great powers of {context}, not forgetting the relevance of the Papal States in central Italy, which has influence throughout Europe. The Papacy, despite going through moments of crisis, such as the Western Schism, is able to regain and strengthen its temporal power, under the pontificate of Sixtus IV and Alexander VI; ecclesiastical politics becomes increasingly active and ambitious, often intertwined with the interests of the great Italian families. It is in this scenario that, in 1475, you {player_name} of the {family_name} family are born, among the oldest and most influential of {city}. \nYou are a younger son: the right of inheritance has faded away only for a short time. In an age when every decision can change the destinies of a family, or even of a State, you will have to carefully weigh every move. It is up to you, therefore, to decide what career to undertake...",


  "career_choice": "Your heart is young, but life already asks you to choose: which path will you take to leave a mark on the world? Destiny places two paths before you.\n1 - Priest: A life dedicated to God, to the word, to mystery.\n2 - Soldier: A life forged in iron and blood, in service to power.\n",


  "firenze_input": "What do you do?\n1 - You defend him from accusations\n2 - You only limit the disorders\n",
  "firenze_init": "In 1494 the theocratic regime of Girolamo Savonarola, the unarmed prophet, was installed. He applies a reform of customs, but is criticized for various aspects and prophesies the arrival of an enemy who will invade Italy from the Alps.\n",
  "firenze1": "You decide to defend Savonarola, convinced that his ascetic vision represents a true spiritual rebirth for Florence. His words inflame consciences, and under your influence his sermons become even more listened to. The people acclaim him, the corrupt tremble. But your alliance has a price. The powerful look at you with suspicion. Foreign courts and Rome accuse you of heresy disguised as zeal. Florence becomes an ideological battlefield. Yet, you resist. When the invader crosses the Alps, just as Savonarola had prophesied, the people recognize you as the one who listened to the 'unarmed prophet'. You have gained respect, but you have exposed yourself to the judgment of the world.\n",
  "firenze2_pos": "You don't take sides completely. You let Savonarola preach, but prevent his moralizing fury from overwhelming the city. His 'reforms of customs' are contained, the processions of fire are banned, and the popular tribunals dissolved. Florence remains restless, but stable. The nobles respect you for your moderation, and the Church observes you with prudent approval. Savonarola, isolated, begins to lose grip. When the invader descends from the Alps, the city is uncertain, but not in chaos. You have avoided conflict, but also glory. You are a mediator, not a prophet.\n",
  "firenze2_neg": "You tried for balance. A compromise. You control the fires, dampen Savonarola's excesses, calm the anger of the nobles and the Curia. Florence remains suspended in silent discontent. No one is completely against you... but no one is truly with you. Then the inevitable happens. The invader, whom Savonarola had announced as divine punishment, descends from the Alps with the fury of a fulfilled prophecy. Florence finds itself unprepared, divided, and you are caught in the middle. The prophet's supporters accuse you of extinguishing God's voice. Your political allies abandon you in chaos. In a night of torches and betrayals, you are captured by a furious crowd. There is no trial. Only screams, a square in flames and a judgment without appeal. Your body is left hanging as a warning. The mediator is dead. And history... never remembers the moderates.\n",

  "ven_mil_mant_input": "In 1495 the Holy League was born, which was a military alliance stipulated between Pope Alexander VI, King Ferdinand of Aragon of Naples, the Holy Roman Empire, the Sforzas of Milan and the Republic of Venice. The main objective of the league was to counter the descent into Italy of Charles VIII of France and his claim to conquer the Kingdom of Naples, while the controversial theocratic regime was established in the Republic of Florence. Going up the peninsula, Charles VIII's objective shifted from the conquest of Naples to the conquest of Milan, and the decisive event was the battle of Fornovo in which Mantua, Venice, Milan and Bologna took part against the French. You are a younger soldier and as a citizen of {fam_city} you take part in the battle. \nYou are advised to fight in the second line, however you can decide whether to go to the front line, the choice is yours...\n1 - Front line\n2 - Second line\n",
  "ven_mil_mant_1_pos": "The battle is resolved quickly, but bloodily and having distinguished yourself fighting in the front line you remained seriously wounded. After a few days you are given extreme unction but you finally manage to survive, and you see this as a miracle that was granted to you by the Lord; therefore injured you end your military career, and after this event you dedicate yourself to an ecclesiastical career.\n",
  "ven_mil_mant_1_neg": "Your efforts in battle were not enough, the enemy sword pierces your chest. Your eyes go out forever...",
  "ven_mil_mant_2": "The battle is resolved quickly, but bloodily and being you a younger soldier in your first battle you remain shocked by the atrocity of war, therefore you abandon your military career to help others and become a priest.\n",

  "priest": "As a young man, you had to choose a path. Destiny placed the cassock before you.\n",

  "why_priest_input": "Why did you decide to become a priest?\n1 - By vocation: You felt God's call, clear as a bell in silence.\n2 - By necessity: It was the only way to escape misery, a refuge within sacred walls.\n",
  "why_priest_1": "\"You felt God's call, clear as a bell in silence.\" Since childhood, among the cold stones of the village church, you felt something. It wasn't just the beauty of the lit candles or the solemn song of the priest: it was a voice. A presence. As if God whispered to you from behind the altar. When you wore the cassock for the first time, it wasn't a mask: it was new skin. Every prayer was a step toward truth. Every act of charity, a piece in divine will. Now that you walk among the shadows of power and the lights of ambition, the memory of that voice guides you. Perhaps you will become Pope. But first, you were just a boy who wanted to serve something eternal.\n",
  "why_priest_2": "\"It was the only way to escape misery, a refuge within sacred walls.\" Hunger was a more faithful companion than hope. The streets were hard, and no one extended a hand without pretense. But the Church... offered bread, roof, books. A different world. Becoming a priest was not a choice of spirit, but of survival. You learned Latin from hunger, not from faith. You prayed with open eyes, scrutinizing the mechanisms of power under the vestments of the sacred. Now, climbing the ecclesiastical ladder, you don't forget who you were. You are not blind: you know the game. And if the Lord has truly called you... perhaps, he did so with the voice of hunger.\n",

  "sermon_input": "The years pass. Now you are a priest. Every Sunday, your face rises among the crowd, and your voice guides hearts. \nWhat is the heart of your sermon?\n1 - Justice and mercy: You speak of forgiveness, peace, the duty to help those who suffer.\n2 - Moral decay: You denounce the sins of the time, the abyss that grows beneath society's feet.\n",
  "sermon_1": "\"You speak of forgiveness, peace, the duty to help those who suffer.\" Your words descend lightly, like summer rain on thirsty consciences. Every Sunday, from the pulpit, you invite the faithful to look each other in the eyes. To forgive debts, to break bread with the hungry, to bend over the wounds of the world. You don't shout: you caress. You don't accuse: you console. The poor begin to come just to hear you. Sinners listen to you in silence. Even those who don't believe find in you something missing elsewhere: an echo of authentic goodness. The powerful turn up their noses, but cannot ignore you. Your fame grows like a seed in good soil. Perhaps holiness is not in power... but you, without seeking it, are getting closer.\n",
  "sermon_2": "\"You denounce the sins of the time, the abyss that grows beneath society's feet.\" When you speak, your voice is fire. You don't sweeten. You don't soften. You denounce the greed of merchants, the lust of nobles, the corruption of the clergy. Your sermons resonate like thunder through the naves. Some get up and leave. Others remain, enraptured, trembling. You say that Rome has become Babylon. That the world dances on the edge of hell, and no one wants to see it. Someone calls you a prophet. Someone else, a fanatic. But you don't care. You don't want to be loved. You want them to repent. And so, sermon after sermon, you become the face of a changing time. Or of an approaching storm.\n",

  "present_input": "An uncle of yours, a rich and influential man, offers you a huge sum. But in exchange, he asks for silence about a dirty affair you discovered. \nWhat do you do with the gift?\n1 - You give it to charity: The money goes to the poor, but the sin remains in silence.\n2 - You keep it for yourself: Thinking that maybe one day it will serve you for \"a greater good\".\n3 - You don't accept the gift: You refuse, even if it means ruining relations with your family.\n",
  "present_1": "\"The money goes to the poor, but the sin remains in silence.\" You accept the sum, but with a heavy heart. Not for you. Never for you. The dirty money becomes bread for orphans, medicine for the sick, blankets for those who sleep among stones. In public, you are praised as a generous priest. The crowds follow you. Your gestures inspire imitation. But at night, when you pray, conscience does not remain silent. You know what you covered up. The other's sin has also become yours, dressed in charity. Your fame grows... but so does the shadow that accompanies it.\n",
  "present_2": "\"Thinking that maybe one day it will serve you for a greater good.\" You accept the money in silence, and hide it. Not out of greed, you tell yourself, but out of foresight. Maybe one day you can use it to buy a forbidden book, secretly finance a convent, or bribe the corrupt to stop a worse evil. Thus begins the descent. Small lies, discreet movements of money. But no sin remains hidden forever. A young cleric, too curious, discovers your papers. Voices run. And finally, the storm arrives: you are summoned by an ecclesiastical tribunal. No matter how much you justify yourself, how much you invoke \"future good\" — the coins you accepted weigh more than your words. You are excommunicated. Your name is banned from prayers. Your vestments torn. The faithful turn their backs on you. Even your family, already complicit, disowns you to save themselves. You have lost. You did not become Pope. You became an example... of what one should not be.\n",
  "present_3": "\"You refuse, even if it means ruining relations with your family.\" You look your uncle in the eyes. You feel the weight of family history, childhood dinners, favors received. But your faith – or perhaps just your pride – is stronger. You refuse. His expression changes: respect, then frost. From that day, you are excluded. Your family closes its doors to you. You are a stranger among your own. But inside, a deep peace. You have chosen truth. Even if it hurts. Even if it costs. Maybe God has seen. Maybe not. But you know you don't have to lower your eyes before anyone.\n",

  "become_parson_input": "You are offered to become a parish priest right in your native parish. The community knows you, loves you and also judges you. \nDo you accept the position?\n1 - Yes: You want to guide your people.\n2 - No: You fear that the past follows you too closely.\n",
  "become_parson_1": "\"You accept. You want to be the guide where once you were just a face among others.\" Returning home is not easy, but you do it with your head held high. You walk through the same streets where as a child you ran barefoot, now with the cassock on and the weight of guidance on your shoulders. Some look at you with sincere affection, others with suspicion. They remember how you were, and perhaps they don't believe what you have become. But you don't let yourself be held back. You celebrate masses with ardor, listen to confessions with patience, offer advice even to those who had despised you. Day after day, your example begins to speak louder than memories. The past accompanies you, yes — but it doesn't command you. And perhaps it is precisely there, among those who saw you born, that your true ascent begins.\n",
  "become_parson_2": "\"You give up. Not out of fear, but out of prudence.\" The offer touches your heart, but you know that the ground there is fragile. Every word of yours would be weighed. Every gesture of yours compared with who you were, not with who you are. You prefer to decline. You leave the place to another, and move away in silence. A painful, but necessary detachment. In a new place, you will be able to build without shadows, without old glances that read the past in every sermon of yours. Maybe one day you will return. As a bishop, as a cardinal... or as pope. But not yet.\n",

  "cardinal_letter_input": "One morning, you receive a sealed letter. It's from an influential cardinal: he is starting an ambitious project to \"renew the Church\". The tone is solemn, but the words leave room for interpretation. \nWhat do you do?\n1 - You actively enter the project: You join with enthusiasm, ready to climb the hierarchy.\n2 - You support informally: You show interest, but remain prudent.\n3 - You ignore the letter: Maybe it's better not to get involved.\n",
  "cardinal_letter_1": "\"You join with enthusiasm, ready to climb the hierarchy.\" You respond without hesitation. Your words are decisive, respectful but ambitious. You put yourself at the service of the cardinal, offer ideas, make yourself visible. You meet prelates, participate in reserved councils, learn to move between silences and glances. The project takes shape. There is talk of reforms, but behind the scenes alliances are forged. You are there. And when someone has to speak in public, or sign a delicate document, it often falls to you. You are building a name for yourself. The road to Rome is no longer a dream. It's a map, and you just got a guide.\n",
  "cardinal_letter_2": "\"You show interest, but remain prudent.\" You write a courteous reply. Flattered, interested, but you don't commit. You participate in some meetings, send reserved comments, maintain a low profile. Your name appears in documents, but at the bottom of pages. If the project failed, you could always say you were never really involved. But if it succeeds... you could rise without ever having exposed yourself too much. Prudence protects you. But it also slows your ascent.\n",
  "cardinal_letter_3": "\"Maybe it's better not to get involved.\" You leave it on the table for days, then put it away with the others. No response. Maybe it's fear. Or maybe it's wisdom. You've seen too many reformers burn themselves, too many dreams become heresies in the course of a synod. You continue your local work. Masses, confessions, charity. Someone says you are a just man, but not very ambitious. Others forget you. The letter, over time, becomes just a sealed regret.\n",

  "annul_marriage_input": "A noble and a bourgeois both ask you to annul their marriages. You know that one is politically useful. The other is just... human. \nWhat do you decide?\n1 - You annul both: The law is the law.\n2 - You annul only the noble's: A strategic favor.\n3 - You annul only the bourgeois': You follow your conscience.\n4 - You don't annul either: Marriage is sacred.\n",
  "annul_marriage_1": "\"The law is the law.\" You examine the cases with rigor. You study documents, listen to testimonies, evaluate according to doctrine. Rank doesn't matter, influence doesn't count: only canonical truth matters. You annul both marriages, causing amazement and turmoil. The noble looks at you with cold respect: you are not manipulable. The bourgeois embraces you in tears: for him, you were just. Your reputation grows as that of a fair man, but feared. Those who seek an easy favor will get nothing from you.\n",
  "annul_marriage_2_pos": "\"A strategic favor.\" You don't hesitate too much. You know that the noble has friends in Rome, powerful supporters, voices that can lift you up... or crush you. The annulment is granted. Quick, clean, well motivated. The bourgeois receives a cold, formal response. He suffers. But you look elsewhere. A few months later, you receive an invitation to a banquet. Then a sealed letter from a cardinal. You are rising, it's true. But inside you... something has stopped looking you in the eyes.\n",
  "annul_marriage_2_neg": "Attempting to annul only one of the marriages is a deadly action. The Curia discovers it immediately. The abuse of your authority is judged serious. You are excommunicated. The faithful turn their backs on you, the family disowns you. Your ecclesiastical career ends here.",
  "annul_marriage_3_pos": "\"You follow your conscience.\" The noble's request is politically useful, but full of falsehoods. His marriage is just a pawn. Instead, the bourgeois comes with his wife by his side, trembling hands and eyes full of sincere pain. You take days to pray. And in the end, you choose: you annul only that marriage. The noble is furious. He puts pressure. The voices about you become poisonous in power circles. But the people defend you. And someone, in silence, begins to believe that you are truly different.\n",
  "annul_marriage_3_neg": "Attempting to annul only one of the marriages is a deadly action. The Curia discovers it immediately. The abuse of your authority is judged serious. You are excommunicated. The faithful turn their backs on you, the family disowns you. Your ecclesiastical career ends here.",
  "annul_marriage_4": "\"Marriage is sacred.\" You receive them both. You listen. But you remain firm. Your voice doesn't tremble when you pronounce the sentence: \"What God has joined together, let no man separate.\" The two men leave the room with opposite expressions: the noble, offended. The bourgeois, defeated. But you don't judge emotions — only souls. For many you are inflexible. For others, incorruptible. But within the Church, there are voices that begin to wonder: is it firmness... or simple rigidity?\n",

  "become_bishop_pos": "The day is gray, as if the sky itself wanted to hold its breath. In your room, silent and austere, a letter bears the seal of the Holy See. Your hands tremble. Your lips move in a prayer that is not only of gratitude, but also of fear. \"By the grace of God and the will of the Holy Father, you have been chosen as the new Bishop of...\" The rest vanishes, swallowed by the beating of your heart. You have chosen, sometimes with firmness, others with hesitation. You have spoken to crowds, sometimes with truth, others with prudence. You have shaken dirty hands to build bridges and perhaps, sometimes, to not remain alone. Yet, you have come this far. On the day of consecration, the cathedral is full. The eyes pointed at you are many: some full of hope, others of suspicion, some just looking for signs of weakness. When the episcopal ring is slipped onto your finger, you don't just feel honor. You feel the weight. When they hand you the pastoral staff, you don't just feel power. You feel responsibility. When the choir intones the Te Deum, you look up. But you also think about what lies below: ambition, compromise, choice.\n",
  "become_bishop_neg": "You have walked along the corridors of power with uncertain steps, wearing the garb of humility but never obtaining the weight of grace. The Consistory has spoken. Your efforts, though fervent, have not convinced. Your sermons have been heard, but not remembered. Your works have raised dust, but not souls. The College of Cardinals has decided to look elsewhere. The title of Bishop remains unattainable. The pontifical throne, a dream that vanishes like incense in the wind. Now you return to your monastery, among the shelves of forgotten manuscripts and the shadows of extinguished candles. Your journey ends here, not with excommunication, but with silence. You did not become Pope. You did not even become Bishop. Perhaps, in another life, with more faith... or more cunning...",

  "residence_input": "Now that you have become Bishop your importance within the political life of your country is extremely higher, in particular you have the possibility to collect taxes, manage documents, preserve resources and bring local issues to the curia. However, precisely because you have such relevance, you are proposed, as is normal in these years, to be able to reside in Rome, instead of in {fam_city}. Clearly the choice is yours, whether you prefer to give value to your local mission or try to acquire greater relevance in the clergy.\n1 - Stay in your bishopric\n2 - Go to reside in the Papal States\n",
  "residence_1": "By choosing to reside in your bishopric, you have earned the support of the citizens, who now see you as a fundamental reference figure in the life of the country, your popular consensus increases accordingly.\n",
  "residence_2": "Good! You have moved to Rome, now you will be able to manage the great theological questions, meet the \"big shots\" and have a direct relationship with the decisions made by the curia. However, your people pay the price, who feel abandoned and left at the mercy of the important noble families of the area.\n",

  "taxation_input": "As soon as you are installed in your bishopric, you realize that governing a diocese requires more than faith alone. The accounts are in disorder, the harvest has been poor and the needs of the clergy grow every day. Sitting in your study, with the budget open in front of you, you are posed the first real choice of your mandate:\n1 - Increase taxation\n2 - Keep taxation unchanged\n",
  "taxation_1": "The diocese's coffers fill slowly, and your projects begin to take shape: new pews in the cathedral, more precious parchments, a choir that finally sings in unison. But in the streets, voices become more bitter. The peasants whisper tired prayers, and someone begins to look toward nearby monasteries, where life seems more just. You have strengthened the throne... but cracked the pulpit.\n",
  "taxation_2": "The people bless you in the markets and in the fields. Children greet you running, and the elderly call you \"good father\". But the sacristy roof continues to drip, and your secretary shakes his head while scrolling through the account books. In Rome, few notice merciful bishops. You have won the hearts of your flock... but perhaps lost ground on the way to the pontifical throne.\n",

  "help_cardinal_input": "In your new home, you make the acquaintance of a very important Cardinal, Cardinal Petrucci, from Siena, who asks you for help. His brother, a fiscal official in Siena, has been condemned for corruption, and would need a place to reside to hide while waiting for the charge to be withdrawn. Being you just arrived, Cardinal Petrucci believes it is easier to get a yes from you, but you must decide what to do.\n1 - You accept and help Cardinal Petrucci\n2 - You don't accept and remain faithful to your principles\n",
  "help_cardinal_1": "Cardinal Petrucci is grateful to you, he will remember it, now you also have important friends in the papal states. But the citizens of your bishopric are not so happy about this, the word spreads and a criminal in town is not welcome, especially if this can sour relations with other lordships.\n",
  "help_cardinal_2": "You held a hard line, you denied help to a cardinal, he recognizes your character, but will not be happy about it. This is however appreciated by the citizens who see you as an important figure for them and for your city.\n",

  "lega_cambrai_input": "We are now in 1508, the conflicts in Italy, which have not particularly affected you, have meant that Venice has become a great power, perhaps too great, in Italy. At this point the pope, Julius II, proposes the creation of the League of Cambrai, uniting France, Empire and Spain to counter the Italian question. As a bishop you are called to decide how to behave, you now have enough importance to cover different roles.\n1 - Remain neutral\n2 - Oppose the League\n3 - Go to battle\n4 - Become ambassador for the Papal States\n",
  "lega_cambrai_1": "You prefer not to take sides in this conflict. You decide that the Church must maintain a role of peace, avoiding getting directly involved in earthly wars. Neutrality is safe ground, but also fragile: the powerful observe you with suspicion, wondering if you are courage or fear. While Venice grows uncontrolled, you pray for wisdom and peace, aware that silence is sometimes more eloquent than weapons.\n",
  "lega_cambrai_2": "You see in the League a threat to balance and to Italy. With firmness, you take a position against the alliance proposed by Julius II. You warn your brothers about the consequences of excessive power concentrated in foreign hands and the devastation that war would bring. Your voice is a beacon for those who fear the loss of Italian sovereignty, but you also gain powerful enemies who see you as an obstacle to remove.\n",
  "lega_cambrai_3": "Faith is also defended with the sword. You accept to lead or support the Church's troops in this decisive war. Your role becomes concrete, among swords and the smoke of battle. You risk your life, but also glory. The blood shed for faith can open the way to a future of power and respect. Or to a premature end.\n",
  "lega_cambrai_4": "You prefer diplomacy to war. You accept the assignment to represent the Pope at foreign courts. Your charisma and intelligence will be decisive weapons in the complex network of alliances and betrayals. In the palace, between banquets and intrigues, you will shape the destiny of the Church without shedding a drop of blood. But diplomacy is a subtle game, where a false step can cost everything.\n",

  "opposer_input": "Opposing the League, yes... but how? With a loud and public voice, risking excommunications and accusations of treason? Or in the shadows, with discretion and diplomacy, to preserve your role and your ascent?\n1 - Publicly\n2 - In the shadows\n",
  "opposer_1_pos": "You stand up, making the wood of the chair creak, and grasp the pen with a firm hand. Your signature will appear on open letters, proclamations and homilies: words as heavy as swords. You will denounce greed disguised as crusade, openly challenge the principles of the League and perhaps, even, the will of the Holy Father. You know this could cost you everything: the diocese, political protection, perhaps even your life. But your heart is steady, and your faith guides you. If the truth must be told, you will tell it.\n",
  "opposer_1_neg": "The decree arrives at dawn, carried by an exhausted horse and trembling hands. The messenger doesn't dare look you in the eyes while delivering the parchment. You break the seal with cold fingers. The words, written in solemn Latin, strike you like an eternal judgment: anathema sit. Excommunicated. The cathedral bells ring for the dead, but not for a body — for a soul cut off from the Church. Your allies dissolve like mist in the sun, the faithful avoid your gaze, and even the statues seem to turn away. In an instant, you have gone from respected bishop to cursed shadow. Yet, in the depths of your private cell, between bare walls and the silence of the renounced, you still feel the flame of justice burning. The Church has cast you out.\n",
  "opposer_2": "You remain seated, your gaze fixed on the silver chalice on the shelf. You know that one false step could make you disappear from the sacred game of power. But silence is not complicity, if used with cunning. You will act through trusted contacts, favor the League's enemies with discreet support, support peace where you can and weaken war where it serves. You will not be a martyr, but a mind in the shadows. One day, perhaps, the church will need a skilful pope more than an audacious one — and you will be ready.\n",

  "battle_input": "You wear armor over your bishop's robe and lead men to war. You will be at the Pope's side in the campaigns against Venice, and your loyalty will not go unnoticed. You can choose what to do, how to live the battle\n1 - Go to the front line\n2 - Stay in the rear\n",
  "battle_1": "You mount your horse, grip your sword, and place yourself in front of your men. You shout a psalm, and launch the charge. You want to show that faith can also be fire and steel. Earning the respect of the pontifical throne\n",
  "battle_2": "You stop near the rear. Your hands tremble, prayers intertwine with panic. You are not made for war, you understand that now. You watch your men go, and you only hope they return. Now however, the attack is not certain to go well, you could fail or succeed in a great enterprise.\n",

  "front_battle_neg_1": "A sudden blow knocks you off your horse. The troops scatter, the enemy drums beat loudly. The mud envelops you, your helmet is broken. Someone saves you, maybe a faithful soldier, maybe just chance. Your arms are injured, your body bleeds, but you cling to life with a thread of breath. You are forced to retreat, but despite this you survive until you recover completely, after months.\n",
  "front_battle_neg_2": "Blood now flows in rivers, you no longer feel your body, your eyes go out, the wound has brought you to death. Your ascent to the throne of Peter ends here.\n",
  "front_battle_pos": "The sun rose red over the battlefield, coloring the sky the color of spilled blood and that which would still be shed. You had long since left the silent halls of monasteries and the marble corridors of cathedrals: now you wore the cross on your chest, but also the sword at your side. You still wore bishop's robes, but above them, the armor glittered. Your decision to join the League of Cambrai had not been made lightly. But the Pope himself, Julius II — the \"warrior Pope\" — had blessed the cause. Venice had challenged the authority of the Holy See too long, and you, man of God and man of action, had answered the call. The troops marched under your command. Nobles and soldiers, peasants and knights, followed you not only for your strategic ability, but for your unshakeable faith. You carried a sacred relic with you, and prayed every evening before battle. Your men said that where you raised the standard, victory was not long in coming. And so it was. The battle was harsh, but your firm guidance, your courage and your devotion inspired a fervor that not even the most experienced commanders could replicate. The Venetian forces scattered like dust in the wind. At the end of the clash, with the field quiet and the fog of war retreating, your name was on everyone's lips. Soon the messenger from Rome arrived. He was dressed in purple and gold, and carried a papal seal. He knelt before you and read aloud: \"In recognition of your valor in battle, your unwavering loyalty to the Holy Church, and your sacred devotion, His Holiness Pope Julius II elevates you to the dignity of Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church. May your new purple be as ardent as the fire of your faith.\" The crowd exploded in a chorus of jubilation. You bowed your head, in silent prayer. But you knew, deep down, that this was only a step. A step on the way to the Tiara. The Cross now shone closer.\n",

  "ambassador_input": "You have chosen the path of the ambassador. Now the Pope counts on you to defend the Church's interests in foreign lands. Before leaving, however, you must decide where you will carry out your mission. The papal secretary brings you two sealed letters. One sends you to France, the other to the Holy Roman Empire. What do you choose?\n1 - France\n2 - Holy Roman Empire\n",
  "ambassador_france": "You choose to go to the Kingdom of France, to the court of Louis XII, relations are excellent. France is allied with the Pope in the war against Venice. The King is powerful and his court is full of nobles and bishops.\n",
  "ambassador_sri_input": "The Empire is large and complicated. Local princes begin to doubt the Church, and the Pope looks with suspicion at certain ideas that are starting to circulate. You can act in two ways:\n1 - Harshly\n2 - In a calm manner\n",
  "ambassador_sri_strong": "You speak clearly and forcefully. You represent the Pope's authority. You demand obedience and threaten those who oppose you.\n",
  "ambassador_sri_calm": "You seek dialogue, listen, speak tactfully. You deal with princes and cities to maintain peace and strengthen faith.\n",

  "lega_santa_input": "It is 1511, Julius II has forged a new pact: the Holy League. Against France, former ally, now growing threat. Borders tremble, alliances break, consciences divide. The world watches... and you? You have kept silence while others shouted. You have protected the flock while bishops and ambassadors divided up the maps. But now war leaves you no more margin. Fields burn, churches divide, nobles knock at your door demanding an answer. The time of balance is over. Now you must choose how to take sides.\n1 - In favor of the Holy League\n2 - Against the Holy League\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_1": "After months of silence and reflection, you decide that the time for inaction is over. Now that the French threat becomes more real, siding with the Holy League means defending the Church and Italy from an imminent danger. Your brothers appreciate the courage, and you enter the game with force, ready to support the Pope in the war that rages. Your silence transforms into voice, your prudence into decision.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_2": "As an ambassador, your diplomacy now supports the Holy League. You use every word, every smile to weave alliances and strengthen the Pope's position. Your role is decisive in preventing the war from turning into a total disaster. Behind the scenes, however, you know that every negotiation hides painful compromises and silent betrayals.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_3": "As an ambassador, your diplomacy now supports the Holy League. You use every word, every smile to weave alliances and strengthen the Pope's position. Your role is decisive in preventing the war from turning into a total disaster. Behind the scenes, however, you know that every negotiation hides painful compromises and silent betrayals.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_4": "As an ambassador, your diplomacy now supports the Holy League. You use every word, every smile to weave alliances and strengthen the Pope's position. Your role is decisive in preventing the war from turning into a total disaster. Behind the scenes, however, you know that every negotiation hides painful compromises and silent betrayals.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_5": "Despite your past opposition, the situation forces you to reconsider. The Holy League is the last hope to stop France, an enemy too dangerous to be ignored. Your support comes as a signal of unity, a gesture that aims to save what remains of peace and papal authority. But your detractors accuse you of inconsistency. You respond that loyalty to the Church comes before everything else.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_6": "Blood flows, wounds burn, but you do not bend the knee. Your dedication to the Holy League has led you to risk everything, and physical pain is just a price to pay for faith and power. Your courage inspires those around you, your suffering becomes legend. Yet, you know that scars will carry weight even beyond the war, marking every future step.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_7": "The battlefield is a theater of fire and flames, but fortune has been on your side. You have led the troops with courage and cunning, without suffering wounds. Your figure emerges as a symbol of strength and resilience, ready to support the Holy League's cause with the vigor of one who has proven his worth without ever wavering. Your allies look at you with admiration, enemies with respect — but you know the war is just beginning.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_1": "You remain consistent with your choice of neutrality, but this time the stakes are higher. The Holy League, with its ferocity, seems to you another source of devastation. You openly criticize the alliance, but many look at you with suspicion. The Pope sees you as an obstacle, and nobles begin to doubt your loyalty. The time of neutrality has passed. Now you risk everything.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_2": "While others sign pacts and shake hands, you choose the path of diplomatic dissent. You denounce the Holy League as a source of useless conflict, propose peaceful alternatives, even if few listen to you. Your position is risky: you put your career and your very life at stake. But in history, perhaps you will be remembered as the one who had the courage to say no.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_3": "While others sign pacts and shake hands, you choose the path of diplomatic dissent. You denounce the Holy League as a source of useless conflict, propose peaceful alternatives, even if few listen to you. Your position is risky: you put your career and your very life at stake. But in history, perhaps you will be remembered as the one who had the courage to say no.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_4": "While others sign pacts and shake hands, you choose the path of diplomatic dissent. You denounce the Holy League as a source of useless conflict, propose peaceful alternatives, even if few listen to you. Your position is risky: you put your career and your very life at stake. But in history, perhaps you will be remembered as the one who had the courage to say no.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_5": "You remain firm in your convictions: the Holy League is just another form of war and oppression. Your opposition becomes harder, almost an act of rebellion. Many fear you, some avoid you. But among common people and disillusioned nobles, you gather silent consensus. You are a beacon for those who dream of a free Italy and a less warlike Church.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_6": "Wounded in battle, your choice to oppose the Holy League takes on an even deeper meaning. Your body marks the price of conflict, while your soul remains faithful to what you believe. Your suffering makes you a symbol of resistance, an example for those who refuse the war imposed by the League. But the road is hard and recovery uncertain. The risk is great, but your cause is worth every pain.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_7": "You chose to fight, but not alongside the League. Despite not suffering wounds, the weight of battle weighs on you: you fight for an ideal, challenging established powers. Your presence on the field is a strong signal of dissent, yet the lack of wounds allows you to maintain lucidity and strategy to guide those who share your cause. The price of war is high, but your determination does not fade.\n",

  "become_cardinal_pos": "The bells of Rome resound with a solemn and deep echo, while the Pope himself confers upon you the precious red ring. That sign of fire is not just an ornament, but a symbol of power and responsibility that you now carry with dignity on your fingers. You have entered the Church's elite, among those who shape the destiny of faith and nations. Your steps echo in the Vatican corridors, where decisions intertwine with intrigues and visions of a better world. Your gaze settles beyond the horizon: the papal tiara is not far, and you are ready to climb, one step at a time, toward that dream.\n",
  "become_cardinal_neg": "You have crossed sacred thresholds with a devout heart, but with hesitant steps. You have worn the garment of humility like a second skin, but have never received the seal of trust. The Curia has observed. Your prayers have risen to heaven, but have not shaken the earth. Your teachings have crossed the naves, but have not left a trace in the soul of the College. The Holy Father has chosen to turn his gaze elsewhere. The cardinal's hat has never grazed your head. The papal throne, a mirage that vanishes before you can even pronounce its name. Now you return to the silence of your cloister, among yellowed parchments and unspoken thoughts. Your ascent has been interrupted not by fault, but by lack of destiny. You have not become Pope. You were not even chosen as Cardinal. Perhaps, in another time, with more charisma... or fewer scruples...\n",

  "conclave_compare": "The Vatican doors close with a dry thud, isolating the cardinals from the outside world. The Sistine Chapel transforms into a theater of heavy silences, where every glance weighs like a judgment, and every whisper can be a secret or a threat. Outside, Rome waits with bated breath, aware that inside the destiny of the Church and perhaps of the whole world is being decided. White and black smoke alternate, mysterious signals of hope or stalemate. Hours and days follow one another, while voices intertwine between dark alliances and unspoken promises. Your heart beats fast, knowing that a single word, a single vote, can change everything. Finally, the moment of counting arrives. The cardinals gather around the great table, hands barely trembling, eyes meeting with a mixture of hope and fear. One parchment after another, names are read aloud. Each vote is a blow that echoes in the chapel: some hold their breath, some clench their fists, some pray silently. Your name could appear at any moment. The silence becomes almost palpable, broken only by the rustling of papers and the whisper of broken promises. The destiny of centuries is in the hands of that small group, and each vote weighs like a boulder. Your heart beats fast, your breath becomes short, while the last vote is pronounced. A moment of exhausting wait, then the sentence: someone has been chosen. Or perhaps not, and the smoke will rise again, black, carrying with it the tension of a new day of uncertainty.\n",

  "pope_nomination": "After years of Vatican intrigues, diplomatic maneuvers, secret prayers and suspicious miracles... you have succeeded. The Sistine Chapel is silent. The crowd in St. Peter's Square holds its breath. A thin thread of white smoke rises slowly in the Roman sky. It is the signal. It is the moment. It is you. The cardinals have chosen you. After long votes and whispers behind ancient wooden stalls, the decision has arrived: you have been elected Pontiff, spiritual guide of over a billion faithful. The throne of Peter is now yours. The Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations approaches and whispers to you: 'Sanctitas tua, what do you wish to be called?' Choose a name. Perhaps a tribute to the saints. Perhaps a sign of rupture. But now you are no longer just a man. You are the Vicar of Christ. You wear the white papal vestment. You look at yourself one last time in the mirror, but the reflected man is no longer you: it is the Pope. The Cardinal Protodeacon appears on the central balcony and announces: 'Habemus Papam!' The square explodes in a roar of jubilation. Bells. Tears. Faiths that renew themselves. You have won. Not just the game. You have conquered the heart of the Church. The world now looks at you. Every word, every gesture will be history. But only the beginning of the pontificate. May God guide you... Your Holiness.\n",
  "WIN": "YOU HAVE WON!"
