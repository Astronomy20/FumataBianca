  "start": "We are at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries, in the heart of the Italian Renaissance. A period in which the peninsula is widely fragmented into a multitude of constantly competing duchies, lordships, kingdoms, and republics. The political scene is dominated by the great powers of {context}, without forgetting the relevance of the Papal States in central Italy, which has influence throughout Europe. The Papacy, despite going through moments of crisis, such as the Western Schism, was able to regain and strengthen its temporal power under the pontificates of Sixtus IV and Alexander VI; ecclesiastical politics became increasingly active and ambitious, often intertwined with the interests of the great Italian families. It is in this scenario that, in 1475, you {player_name} are born into the {family_name} family, one of the oldest and most influential in {city}. You are a younger son: the right to inheritance slipped away by just a little. In an age where every decision can change the destinies of a family, or even a state, you will have to carefully weigh every move. It is up to you, therefore, to decide what career to pursue...",

  "career_choice": "Your heart is young, but life already demands you choose: which path will you take to leave your mark on the world? Destiny places two paths before you.\n1 - Priest: A life dedicated to God, to the word, to mystery.\n2 - Soldier: A life forged in iron and blood, in service of power.\n",

  "firenze_input": "What do you decide to do?\n1 - Defend Savonarola from the accusations\n2 - Contain the unrest, without taking sides\n",
  "firenze_init": "In 1494, Girolamo Savonarola seized power in Florence and established a theocratic regime. He preached radical moral reforms and announced the imminent arrival of an invader who would punish Italy's sins. His words shook the city, but also caused deep divisions.",
  "firenze_1": "You choose to openly support Savonarola. You see in him an authentic spiritual renewal for Florence. His words, thanks also to your support, find an increasingly wide audience. Citizens acclaim him, the powerful tremble. However, your position exposes you to criticism: Rome and foreign courts accuse you of heresy disguised as faith. Florence transforms into an ideological battlefield. When, as prophesied, a foreign army invades Italy, many consider you a visionary who listened to the unarmed prophet. You have gained respect, but at a high price.",
  "firenze_2_pos": "You decide not to take a clear position. You allow Savonarola to preach, but curb his excesses. You block the most radical processions and dismantle the popular tribunals. The city remains in precarious balance, but does not plunge into chaos. Nobles respect you for your moderation, and the Church watches you with cautious approval. When the invader arrives, Florence is frightened but stable. You did not shine for courage, but neither for passivity. You were a mediator, but you understood that a life devoted to God is the only path to serenity and peace. For this reason, you decide to become a priest.",
  "firenze_2_neg": "You try to maintain a balance between Savonarola's power and the pressure from the nobles. You control the bonfires, moderate the sermons, attempt compromises. But you satisfy no one. When the foreign invasion materializes, the city is divided. Supporters of the prophet accuse you of having extinguished the voice of God. Your political allies abandon you. On a night of violence, you are captured by an enraged mob. There is no trial, only a summary execution in the square. Your body becomes a warning. History does not remember those who tried to stay in the middle.",

  "ven_mil_mant_input": "In 1495, the Holy League was formed, a military alliance stipulated between Pope Alexander VI, King Ferdinand of Aragon of Naples, the Holy Roman Empire, the Sforzas of Milan, and the Republic of Venice. The main objective of the league was to counter the descent of Charles VIII of France into Italy and his claim to conquer the Kingdom of Naples, while in the Republic of Florence a controversial theocratic regime was established. Ascending the peninsula, Charles VIII's objective shifted from the conquest of Naples to the conquest of Milan, and the decisive event was the Battle of Fornovo, in which Mantua, Venice, Milan, and Bologna took part against the French. You are a cadet soldier and, as a citizen of {fam_city}, you take part in the battle. You are advised to fight in the second line, however, you can decide whether to go to the front line, the choice is yours...\n1 - Front line\n2 - Second line\n",
  "ven_mil_mant_1_pos": "The battle is resolved quickly, but bloodily, and having distinguished yourself fighting on the front line, you are gravely wounded. After a few days, you are given the last rites but ultimately manage to survive, and you see this as a miracle granted to you by the Lord; therefore, injured, your military career ends. After this event, you understood that a life devoted to God is the only path to serenity and peace. For this reason, you decide to become a priest.\n",
  "ven_mil_mant_1_neg": "Your efforts in battle were not enough, the enemy's sword pierces your chest. Your eyes close forever...",
  "ven_mil_mant_2": "The battle is resolved quickly, but bloodily. You, a cadet soldier in your first battle, are shocked by the atrocity of war, and therefore abandon your military career to help others by becoming a priest.",

  "priest": "As a young man, you had to choose a path. Destiny placed the cassock before you.\n",

  "why_priest_input": "Why did you decide to become a priest?\n1 - By vocation: You felt the call of God, clear as a bell in the silence.\n2 - By necessity: It was the only way to escape misery, a refuge within sacred walls.\n",
  "why_priest_1": "Since childhood, among the cold stones of the village church, you felt something. It wasn't just the beauty of the lit candles or the solemn singing of the priest: it was a voice. A presence. As if God whispered to you from behind the altar. When you wore the cassock for the first time, it wasn't a mask: it was new skin. Every prayer was a step towards truth. Every act of charity, a piece in the divine will. Now that you walk among the shadows of power and the lights of ambition, the memory of that voice guides you. Perhaps you will become Pope. But first, you were just a boy who wanted to serve something eternal.\n",
  "why_priest_2": "Hunger was a more faithful companion than hope. The streets were hard, and no one offered a hand without expectation. But the Church... offered bread, shelter, books. A different world. Becoming a priest was not a choice of spirit, but of survival. You learned Latin out of hunger, not faith. You prayed with open eyes, scrutinizing the mechanisms of power beneath the sacred vestments. Now, climbing the ecclesiastical ladder, you do not forget who you were. You are not blind: you know the game. And if the Lord truly called you... perhaps, he did so with the voice of hunger.\n",

  "sermon_input": "Years pass. You are now a priest. Every Sunday, your face rises among the crowd, and your voice guides hearts. \nWhat is the heart of your sermon?\n1 - Justice and mercy: You speak of forgiveness, peace, the duty to help those who suffer.\n2 - Moral decay: You denounce the sins of the time, the abyss growing beneath society's feet.\n",
  "sermon_1": "Your words fall lightly, like summer rain on thirsty consciences. Every Sunday, from the pulpit, you invite the faithful to look each other in the eye. To forgive debts, to break bread with the hungry, to stoop over the wounds of the world. You do not shout: you caress. You do not accuse: you comfort. The poor begin to come just to hear you. Sinners listen to you in silence. Even those who do not believe find something in you that is missing elsewhere: an echo of authentic goodness. The powerful wrinkle their noses, but they cannot ignore you. Your fame grows like a seed in good soil. Perhaps holiness is not in power... but you, without seeking it, are drawing closer.",
  "sermon_2": "When you speak, your voice is fire. You do not sugarcoat. You do not sweeten. You denounce the greed of merchants, the lust of nobles, the corruption of the clergy. Your sermons resonate like thunder through the naves. Some stand up and leave. Others remain, captivated, trembling. You say that Rome has become Babylon. That the world dances on the edge of hell, and no one wants to see it. Someone calls you a prophet. Someone else, a fanatic. But you don't care. You don't want to be loved. You want them to repent. And so, sermon after sermon, you become the face of a changing time. Or of an approaching storm.\n",

  "present_input": "An uncle of yours, a rich and influential man, offers you a large sum. But in return, he asks for silence on a shady deal you discovered. \nWhat do you do with the gift?\n1 - Give it to charity: The money goes to the poor, but the sin remains in silence.\n2 - Keep it for yourself: Thinking that perhaps one day it will serve for “a greater good”.\n3 - Do not accept the gift: You refuse, even if it means ruining relations with your family.\n",
  "present_1": "You accept the sum, but with a heavy heart. Not for yourself. Never for yourself. The dirty money becomes bread for orphans, medicine for the sick, blankets for those sleeping on the streets. In public, you are praised as a generous priest. Crowds follow you. Your gestures inspire imitation. But at night, when you pray, your conscience does not fall silent. You know what you covered up. The sin of another has also become yours, dressed in charity. Your fame grows... but so does the shadow that accompanies it.\n",
  "present_2": "You accept the money in silence, and hide it. Not out of greed, you tell yourself, but out of foresight. Perhaps one day you can use it to buy a forbidden book, secretly finance a convent, or corrupt the corrupt to stop a greater evil. Thus begins the descent. Small lies, discreet movements of money. But no sin remains hidden forever. A curious young cleric discovers your papers. Rumors spread. And finally, the storm arrives: you are summoned by an ecclesiastical tribunal. No matter how much you justify yourself, how much you invoke “future good” — the coins you accepted weigh more than your words. You are excommunicated. Your name is banned from prayers. The faithful turn their backs on you. Even your family, already complicit, disowns you to save themselves. You lost. You did not become Pope. You became an example... of what not to be.\n",
  "present_3": "You look your uncle in the eyes. You feel the weight of family history, of childhood lunches, of favors received. But your faith - or perhaps just your pride - is stronger. You refuse. His expression changes: respect, then coldness. From that day, you are excluded. Your family closes its doors to you. You are a stranger among your own. But inside, a deep peace. You chose the truth. Even if it hurts. Even if it costs. Perhaps God saw. Perhaps not. But you know you don't have to lower your eyes before anyone.\n",

  "become_parson_input": "You are offered to become a parish priest in your home parish. The community knows you, loves you, and also judges you. \nDo you accept the assignment?\n1 - Yes: You want to lead your people.\n2 - No: You fear the past will follow you too closely.\n",
  "become_parson_1": "Returning home isn't easy, but you do it with your head held high. You walk the same streets where you ran barefoot as a child, now wearing the cassock and the weight of leadership on your shoulders. Some look at you with sincere affection, others with suspicion. They remember how you were, and perhaps don't believe what you've become. But you don't let it stop you. You celebrate masses with ardor, listen to confessions with patience, offer advice even to those who had scorned you. Day after day, your example begins to speak louder than memories. The past accompanies you, yes — but it doesn't command you. And perhaps it is there, among those who saw you born, that your true ascent begins.\n",
  "become_parson_2": "The offer touches your heart, but you know the ground there is fragile. Every word you speak would be weighed. Every action compared to who you were, not who you are. You prefer to decline. You leave the position to another, and quietly withdraw. A painful but necessary detachment. In a new place, you can build without shadows, without old glances reading the past in every sermon. Perhaps one day you will return. As a bishop, as a cardinal... or as pope. But not yet.\n",

  "cardinal_letter_input": "One morning, you receive a sealed letter. It is from an influential cardinal: he is launching an ambitious project to “renew the Church.” The tone is solemn, but the words leave room for interpretation. \nWhat do you do?\n1 - Actively join the project: You join with enthusiasm, ready to climb the hierarchy.\n2 - Support informally: You show interest, but remain cautious.\n3 - Ignore the letter: Perhaps it's better not to get involved.\n",
  "cardinal_letter_1": "You respond without hesitation. Your words are decisive, respectful but ambitious. You place yourself at the cardinal's service, offer ideas, make yourself visible. You meet prelates, participate in private councils, learn to navigate silences and glances. The project takes shape. There is talk of reforms, but behind the scenes alliances are forged. You are there. And when someone needs to speak publicly, or sign a delicate document, it often falls to you. You are building a name for yourself. The road to Rome is no longer a dream. It is a map, and you have just obtained a guide.\n",
  "cardinal_letter_2": "You write a polite reply. Flattered, interested, but you don't commit. You participate in a few meetings, send private comments, keep a low profile. Your name appears in documents, but at the bottom of the pages. If the project fails, you could always say you were never truly involved. But if it succeeds... you could rise without having exposed yourself too much. Prudence protects you. But it also slows your ascent.\n",
  "cardinal_letter_3": "You leave it on the table for days, then put it away with the others. No answer. Perhaps it's fear. Or perhaps it's wisdom. You've seen too many reformers burn out, too many dreams become heresies within a synod. You continue your local work. Masses, confessions, charity. Some say you are a righteous man, but not very ambitious. Others forget you. The letter, over time, becomes just a sealed regret.\n",

  "annul_marriage_input": "A noble and a commoner both ask you for the annulment of their marriages. You know one is politically useful. The other is simply... human. \nWhat do you decide?\n1 - Annul both: The pressure is too much\n2 - Annul only the commoner's: You consider it a strategic favor.\n3 - Annul only the noble's: You consider it politically useful.\n4 - Annul neither: Marriage is sacred.\n",
  "annul_marriage_1": "The pressure is great... you bend to their power. You examine the cases rigorously. You study documents, listen to testimonies, evaluate according to doctrine. Rank does not matter, influence does not count. You annul both marriages, the noble looks at you with satisfaction, the commoner embraces you, for him, you were just. Your reputation grows as that of a fair man. Those who seek an easy favor know they can come to you.\n",
  "annul_marriage_2_pos": "You consider it a strategic favor, you don't hesitate too much. You know the noble has friends in Rome, powerful supporters, voices that can raise you... or crush you. You destroy the marriage documents. Quick, clean. The commoner receives a cold response: you do not annul his marriage. Inside you, though... something has stopped looking you in the eye.\n",
  "annul_marriage_2_neg": "Attempting to annul a marriage is an inconceivable action. The Curia discovers it immediately. The abuse of your authority is judged severe. You are expelled and excommunicated. The faithful turn their backs on you, your family disowns you. Your ecclesiastical career ends here.",
  "annul_marriage_3_pos": "The noble's request is politically useful, but full of falsehoods. His marriage is just a pawn. Instead, the commoner comes with his wife by his side, trembling hands and eyes full of sincere pain. You take days to pray. And in the end, you choose: you annul only that marriage. The noble is furious. He exerts pressure. Rumors about you become venomous in circles of power. But the people defend you. And someone, in silence, begins to believe that you are truly different.\n",
  "annul_marriage_3_neg": "Attempting to annul a marriage is an inconceivable action. The Curia discovers it immediately. The abuse of your authority is judged severe. You are expelled and excommunicated. The faithful turn their backs on you, your family disowns you. Your ecclesiastical career ends here.",
  "annul_marriage_4": "You receive both. You listen. But you stand firm. Your voice does not tremble when you pronounce the sentence: “What God has united, man must not separate.” The two men leave the room with opposite expressions: the noble, offended. The commoner, defeated. But you do not judge emotions, only souls. To many you are inflexible, to others incorruptible.\n",

  "become_bishop_pos": "The day is gray, as if the sky itself wanted to hold its breath. In your silent, austere room, a letter bears the seal of the Holy See. Your hands tremble. Your lips move in a prayer that is not only of gratitude, but also of fear. “By the grace of God and the will of the Holy Father, you have been chosen as the new Bishop of...” The rest vanishes, swallowed by the beating of your heart. You have chosen, sometimes with firmness, other times with hesitation. You have spoken to crowds, sometimes with truth, other times with caution. You have shaken dirty hands to build bridges and perhaps, sometimes, not to be alone. Yet, you have come this far. On the day of consecration, the cathedral is full. Many eyes are on you: some full of hope, others of suspicion, some seeking only signs of weakness. When the episcopal ring is placed on your finger, you feel not only the honor. You feel the weight. When they hand you the pastoral staff, you feel not only the power. You feel the responsibility. When the choir intones the “Te Deum”, you look up. But you also think of what lies below: ambition, compromise, choice.\n",
  "become_bishop_neg": "You walked the corridors of power with uncertain steps, wearing the cloak of humility but never gaining the weight of grace. The Consistory has spoken. Your efforts, though fervent, did not convince. Your sermons were heard, but not remembered. Your works stirred up dust, but not souls. The College of Cardinals decided to look elsewhere. The title of Bishop remains out of reach. The papal throne, a dream that fades like incense in the wind. You retire to a monastery, among forgotten manuscripts and the shadows of extinguished candles. Your journey ends here in silence. You did not become Pope. You did not even become Bishop. Perhaps, in another life, with more faith... or more cunning...",

  "residence_input": "Now that you have become Bishop, your importance within the political life of your country is extremely higher, in particular you have the possibility of collecting taxes, managing documents, preserving resources and bringing local issues to the Curia. However, precisely because of your relevance, you are offered, as is customary, the opportunity to reside in Rome, instead of in {fam_city}. Clearly the choice is yours, whether you prefer to value your local mission or seek to gain greater relevance in the clergy.\n1 - Remain in your bishopric\n2 - Go to reside in the Papal States\n",
  "residence_1": "By choosing to reside in your bishopric, you have gained the support of the citizens, who now see you as a fundamental reference figure in the country's life; popular approval consequently increases.\n",
  "residence_2": "Good! You have moved to Rome, now you can manage major theological issues, meet the 'big shots' and have a direct relationship with the decisions made by the Curia. However, your people pay the price, feeling abandoned and left at the mercy of the important noble families of the area.\n",

  "taxation_input": "As soon as you take office in your bishopric, you realize that governing a bishopric requires more than just faith. The accounts are in disarray, the harvest has been poor, and the needs of the clergy grow every day. Sitting in your study, with the budget open before you, you are presented with the first real choice of your mandate:\n1 - Increase taxation\n2 - Keep taxation unchanged\n",
  "taxation_1": "The coffers of the bishopric slowly fill, and your projects begin to take shape: new benches in the cathedral, finer parchments, a choir that finally sings in unison. But in the streets, voices grow more bitter. Peasants whisper weary prayers, and some begin to look towards nearby monasteries, where life seems more just. You have strengthened the throne... but cracked the pulpit.\n",
  "taxation_2": "The people bless you in the markets and fields. Children greet you as they run by, and old people call you “good father”. But the sacristy roof continues to leak, and your secretary shakes his head as he scans the account books. In Rome, few notice merciful bishops. You have won the hearts of your flock... but perhaps lost ground on the way to the papal throne.\n",

  "help_cardinal_input": "In your new home, you get to know a very important Cardinal, Cardinal Petrucci, from Siena, who asks you for help. His brother, a tax official in Siena, has been convicted of corruption, and would need a place to reside to hide while waiting for the charges to be dropped. Since you have just arrived, Cardinal Petrucci believes it will be easier to get a yes from you, but you must decide what to do.\n1 - Accept and help Cardinal Petrucci\n2 - Do not accept and remain faithful to your principles\n",
  "help_cardinal_1": "Cardinal Petrucci is grateful to you; he will remember it. Now you also have important friends in the Papal States. But the citizens of your bishopric are not so happy about this; the word spreads, and a criminal in town is not welcome, especially if it can worsen relations with other lordships.\n",
  "help_card_2": "You took a hard line, you denied help to a cardinal; he recognizes your character, but he will not be happy about it. This is nevertheless appreciated by the citizens who see you as an important figure for them and for your city.\n",

  "lega_cambrai_input": "It is now 1508, the conflicts in Italy, which have not particularly affected you, have made Venice a great power, perhaps too great, in Italy. At this point, Pope Julius II proposes the creation of the League of Cambrai, uniting France, the Empire, and Spain to counter the Italian question. As a bishop, you are called upon to decide how to act, you now have enough importance to fill various roles.\n1 - Remain neutral\n2 - Oppose the League\n3 - Go to battle\n4 - Become an ambassador for the Papal States\n",
  "lega_cambrai_1": "You prefer not to take sides in this conflict. You decide that the Church must maintain a role of peace, avoiding direct involvement in earthly wars. Neutrality is safe ground, but also fragile: the powerful watch you with suspicion, wondering if you are courageous or fearful. As Venice grows unchecked, you pray for wisdom and peace, aware that silence is sometimes more eloquent than arms.\n",
  "lega_cambrai_2": "You see the League as a threat to balance and to Italy. Firmly, you take a stand against the alliance proposed by Julius II. You warn your brethren about the consequences of excessive power concentrated in foreign hands and the devastation that war would bring. Your voice is a beacon for those who fear the loss of Italian sovereignty, but you also gain powerful enemies who see you as an obstacle to be removed.\n",
  "lega_cambrai_3": "Faith is also defended with the sword. You agree to lead or support the Church's troops in this decisive war. Your role becomes concrete, amidst swords and battle smoke. You risk your life, but also glory. Blood shed for faith can open the way to a future of power and respect. Or to an untimely end.\n",
  "lega_cambrai_4": "You prefer diplomacy to war. You accept the assignment to represent the Pope at foreign courts. Your charisma and intelligence will be decisive weapons in the complex web of alliances and betrayals. In the palace, amidst banquets and intrigues, you will shape the destiny of the Church without shedding a drop of blood. But diplomacy is a subtle game, where one false step can cost everything.\n",

  "opposer_input": "Oppose the League, yes... but how? With a loud and public voice, risking excommunication and accusations of treason? Or in the shadows, with discretion and diplomacy, to preserve your role and your ascent?\n1 - Publicly\n2 - In the shadows\n",
  "opposer_1_pos": "You stand up, making the chair creak, and grasp the pen with a firm hand. Your signature will appear on open letters, proclamations, and homilies: words heavy as swords. You will denounce greed disguised as a crusade, openly challenge the principles of the League, and perhaps even the will of the Holy Father. You know this could cost you everything: your bishopric, political protection, perhaps even your life. But your heart is steadfast, and your faith guides you. If the truth must be told, you will tell it.\n",
  "opposer_1_neg": "The decree arrived at dawn, brought by a weary horse and trembling hands. The messenger dared not look you in the eye as he delivered the parchment. You broke the seal with cold fingers. The words, written in solemn Latin, struck you like an eternal judgment: anathema sit. Excommunicated. The cathedral bells tolled a death knell, but not for a body — for a soul cut off from the Church. Your allies dissolved like mist in the sun, the faithful avoided your gaze, and even the statues seemed to turn away. In an instant, you went from respected bishop to cursed shadow. Yet, in the depths of your private cell, between bare walls and the silence of the renegades, you still feel the flame of justice burning. The Church cast you out.\n",
  "opposer_2": "You remain seated, your gaze fixed on the silver chalice on the shelf. You know that one false step could make you disappear from the sacred game of power. But silence is not complicity, if used cunningly. You will act through trusted contacts, discreetly favor the League's enemies, support peace where you can and weaken war where necessary. You will not be a martyr, but a mind in the shadows. One day, perhaps, a skilled rather than audacious pope will be needed — and you will be ready.\n",

  "battle_input": "You wear armor over your bishop's robe and lead men to war. You will be by the Pope's side in the campaigns against Venice, and your loyalty will not go unnoticed. You can choose what to do, how to experience the battle\n1 - Go to the front line\n2 - Remain in the rear\n",
  "battle_1": "You mount your horse, grasp your sword, and place yourself at the head of your men. You shout a psalm, and launch the charge. You want to show that faith can also be fire and steel. Earning the respect of the papal throne.\n",
  "battle_2": "You stop near the rear. Your hands tremble, prayers intertwine with panic. You are not made for war, you understand that now. You watch your men go, and just hope they return. Now, however, the attack might not go well; you could fail or succeed in a great endeavor.\n",

  "front_battle_neg_1": "A sudden blow knocks you off your horse. Troops scatter, enemy drums beat loudly. Mud engulfs you, your helmet is broken. Someone saves you, perhaps a loyal soldier, perhaps just chance. Your arms are injured, your body bleeds, but you cling to life by a thread. You are forced to retreat, but despite this, you survive until you fully recover, after months.\n",
  "front_battle_neg_2": "Blood now flows freely, you no longer feel your body, your eyes close forever, the wound has led you to death. Your ascent to the Chair of Peter ends here.\n",
  "front_battle_pos": "The sun rose red over the battlefield, painting the sky the color of blood spilled and yet to be spilled. You had long left the silent halls of monasteries and the marble corridors of cathedrals: now you wore the cross on your chest, but also the sword at your side. You still wore your bishop's robes, but over them, armor shimmered. Your decision to join the League of Cambrai had not been taken lightly. But the Pope himself, Julius II — the “Warrior Pope” — had blessed the cause. Venice had challenged the authority of the Holy See for too long, and you, a man of God and a man of action, had answered the call. The troops marched at your command. Nobles and soldiers, peasants and knights, followed you not only for your strategic ability, but for your unwavering faith. You carried a sacred relic with you, and prayed every evening before battle. Your men said that where you raised the banner, victory was not long in coming. And so it was. The battle was fierce, but your firm leadership, your courage, and your devotion inspired a fervor that even the most experienced commanders could not replicate. The Venetian forces scattered like dust in the wind. At the end of the clash, with the field quiet and the fog of war retreating, your name was on everyone's lips. The messenger from Rome soon arrived. He was dressed in purple and gold, and carried a papal seal. He knelt before you and read aloud: “In recognition of your valor in battle, your unwavering fidelity to the Holy Church, and your sacred devotion, His Holiness Pope Julius II elevates you to the dignity of Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church. May your new purple be as ardent as the fire of your faith.” The crowd erupted in a roar of jubilation. You bowed your head, in silent prayer. But you knew, deep down, that this was just one step. A step on the path to the Tiara. The Cross now shone closer.\n",

  "ambassador_input": "You have chosen the path of the ambassador. Now the Pope relies on you to defend the Church's interests in foreign lands. Before leaving, however, you must decide where you will carry out your mission. The papal secretary hands you two sealed letters. One sends you to France, the other to the Holy Roman Empire. What do you choose?\n1 - France\n2 - Holy Roman Empire\n",
  "ambassador_france": "You choose to go to the Kingdom of France, to the court of Louis XII; relations are excellent. France is allied with the Pope in the war against Venice. The King is powerful and his court is full of nobles and bishops.\n",
  "ambassador_sri_input": "The Empire is vast and complicated. Local princes are beginning to doubt the Church, and the Pope looks with suspicion at certain ideas starting to circulate. You can act in two ways:\n1 - Strictly\n2 - Calmly\n",
  "ambassador_sri_strong": "You speak clearly and loudly. You represent the authority of the Pope. You demand obedience and threaten those who oppose.\n",
  "ambassador_sri_calm": "You seek dialogue, listen, speak with tact. You deal with princes and cities to maintain peace and strengthen faith.\n",

  "lega_santa_input": "It is 1511, Julius II has forged a new pact: the Holy League. Against France, a former ally, now a growing threat. Borders tremble, alliances break, consciences divide. The world watches... and you? You kept silent while others shouted. You protected the flock while bishops and ambassadors divided maps. But now the war leaves you no room. Fields burn, churches divide, nobles knock on your door demanding an answer. The time of balance is over. Now you must choose how to take sides.\n1 - In favor of the Holy League\n2 - Against the Holy League\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_1": "After months of silence and reflection, you decide that the time for inaction is over. Now that the French threat is more real, siding with the Holy League means defending the Church and Italy from an imminent danger. Your brethren appreciate your courage, and you enter the game forcefully, ready to support the Pope in the raging war. Your silence turns into voice, your prudence into decision.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_2": "As an ambassador, your diplomacy now supports the Holy League. You use every word, every smile to weave alliances and strengthen the Pope's position. Your role is decisive in preventing the war from turning into a total disaster. Behind the scenes, however, you know that every negotiation hides painful compromises and silent betrayals.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_3": "As an ambassador, your diplomacy now supports the Holy League. You use every word, every smile to weave alliances and strengthen the Pope's position. Your role is decisive in preventing the war from turning into a total disaster. Behind the scenes, however, you know that every negotiation hides painful compromises and silent betrayals.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_4": "As an ambassador, your diplomacy now supports the Holy League. You use every word, every smile to weave alliances and strengthen the Pope's position. Your role is decisive in preventing the war from turning into a total disaster. Behind the scenes, however, you know that every negotiation hides painful compromises and silent betrayals.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_5": "Despite your past opposition, the situation forces you to rethink. The Holy League is the last hope to stop France, an enemy too dangerous to be ignored. Your support comes as a sign of unity, a gesture aimed at saving what remains of peace and papal authority. But your detractors accuse you of inconsistency. You respond that loyalty to the Church comes before all else.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_6": "Blood flows, wounds burn, but you do not kneel. Your dedication to the Holy League has led you to risk everything, and physical pain is just a price to pay for faith and power. Your courage inspires those around you, your suffering becomes legend. Yet, you know that the scars will bear a weight even beyond the war, marking every future step.\n",
  "lega_santa_pro_7": "The battlefield is a theater of fire and flames, but fortune has been on your side. You led the troops with courage and cunning, without suffering injuries. Your figure emerges as a symbol of strength and resilience, ready to support the cause of the Holy League with the vigor of one who has demonstrated their worth without ever faltering. Your allies look at you with admiration, your enemies with respect — but you know that the war is only just beginning.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_1": "You remain consistent with your choice of neutrality, but this time the stakes are higher. The Holy League, with its ferocity, seems to you an additional source of devastation. You openly criticize the alliance, but many look at you with suspicion. The Pope sees you as an obstacle, and the nobles begin to doubt your loyalty. The time for neutrality has passed. Now you risk everything.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_2": "While others sign treaties and shake hands, you choose the path of diplomatic dissent. You denounce the Holy League as a source of unnecessary conflict, proposing peaceful alternatives, even if few listen. Your position is risky: you put your career and your very life at stake. But in history, perhaps you will be remembered as the one who had the courage to say no.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_3": "While others sign treaties and shake hands, you choose the path of diplomatic dissent. You denounce the Holy League as a source of unnecessary conflict, proposing peaceful alternatives, even if few listen. Your position is risky: you put your career and your very life at stake. But in history, perhaps you will be remembered as the one who had the courage to say no.\n",

But in history, perhaps you will be remembered as the one who had the courage to say no.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_5": "You remain firm in your convictions: the Holy League is just another form of war and oppression. Your opposition becomes harder, almost an act of rebellion. Many fear you, some avoid you. But among the common people and disillusioned nobles, you gather silent consensus. You are a beacon for those who dream of a free Italy and a less warlike Church.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_6": "Wounded in battle, your choice to oppose the Holy League takes on an even deeper meaning. Your body marks the price of conflict, while your soul remains faithful to what you believe. Your suffering makes you a symbol of resistance, an example for those who reject the war imposed by the League. But the road is hard and recovery uncertain. The risk is great, but your cause is worth every pain.\n",
  "lega_santa_contro_7": "You chose to fight, but not alongside the League. Although you did not suffer injuries, the weight of battle weighs on you: you fight for an ideal, challenging established powers. Your presence on the field is a strong signal of dissent, yet the lack of injuries allows you to maintain clarity and strategy to guide those who share your cause. The price of war is high, but your determination does not fade.\n",

  "become_cardinal_pos": "The bells of Rome resonate with a solemn and deep echo, as the Pope himself confers upon you the precious red ring. That fiery sign is not just an adornment, but a symbol of power and responsibility that you now carry with dignity on your fingers. You have entered the elite of the Church, among those who shape the destiny of faith and nations. Your footsteps echo in the corridors of the Vatican, where decisions intertwine with intrigues and visions of a better world. Your gaze rests beyond the horizon: the papal tiara is not far, and you are ready to ascend, one step at a time, towards that dream.\n",
  "become_cardinal_neg": "You have crossed sacred thresholds with a devout heart, but with hesitant steps. You wore the garment of humility as a second skin, but you never received the seal of trust. The Curia observed. Your prayers rose to heaven, but did not shake the earth. Your teachings echoed through the naves, but left no trace in the soul of the College. The Holy Father chose to look elsewhere. The cardinal's hat never touched your head. The papal throne, a mirage that vanishes before you can even utter its name. Now you return to the silence of your cloister, among yellowed parchments and unspoken thoughts. Your ascent ended not by fault, but by lack of destiny. You did not become Pope. You were not even chosen as a Cardinal. Perhaps, in another time, with more charisma... or fewer scruples...\n",

  "conclave_start_input": "The Vatican doors closed just a few hours ago, and already the scent of incense mixes with the more acrid smell of ambition. In the silent corridors, cardinals sound each other out like generals in wartime. Giovanni de' Medici moves with ease: he is young, but feared. His supporters whisper promises of reform and prestige. On the other side, the Spanish front, led by Bernardino López de Carvajal, builds a coalition on ideals of austerity and spiritual renewal.\nFactions quickly form. You can choose to ally with one of these two well-structured blocs, gaining protection and resources. Or you can try the path that will lead you to glory, even if it is more difficult: found your own personal faction, winning votes one by one, building consensus with promises, intimidation, and cunning. It's a risky challenge, but if you succeed... the Church will truly be yours.\n1 - Openly support Giovanni de' Medici\n2 - Ally with the Spanish front led by Carvajal\n3 - Try to create your own independent faction\n",
  "conclave_start_1": "You followed the strongest wind, and at first, it seemed the wisest choice. Dinners with his allies became frequent, laughter abundant, votes promised with every handshake. But Giovanni is too strong, too charismatic, too favored. In the end, your voice was drowned out by the chorus that acclaimed him. When the white smoke rises, it is for him. And you, despite having supported him, gain nothing. Your name is not on the list of favorites. You are not offered any important role. The new Pope rewards the most powerful, not the loyal. The conclave closes, and you leave those walls more anonymous than when you entered.\n",
  "conclave_start_2": "You align with the reformers, alongside the cardinals who dream of a more sober, less corrupt Church. Francisco de Cisneros receives you with the impassive face of one who knows the games of power, but behind his attentive eyes lies an unspoken challenge: here nothing is gained by sympathy. Votes, in this compact bloc, are not gathered with a handshake. You must insinuate yourself into the cracks of consensus, speak where others impose, listen where others preach. It won't be enough to show up, you'll have to convince, face wary glances, overcome more than one obstacle — some silent, others sharp as confessions. If you can walk this thin line without falling, you could become the new face that Spain, perhaps, didn't know it wanted. But beware: even the purest faith can burn those who wield it with too much ambition. Convince the members of your faction to shift their votes to you.\n",
  "conclave_start_3": "You refuse to tie yourself to known names. You decide that your path will pass through uncertainty and pure ambition. Day after day, you approach the most undecided cardinals, speak with the marginalized, listen to the needs of the quietest. You promise appointments, consult private memoirs, offer a hearing where others impose. You start as an echo. Then you become a voice. Then, they whisper about you even in the corridors of power. Some reject you with disdain, others observe you with curiosity. Two votes here, one there. An unexpected alliance. A secret discovered. Your faction grows slowly, but it grows. You are not the easiest option, but you are the only one who owes nothing to anyone. And this, in a conclave, is immense power.\n",

  "spanish_alliance": "You have chosen to move among the ranks of the Spanish faction, the stricter one, more rooted in tradition, but also shaken by internal tensions that few dare to name aloud. Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros welcomed you with the impassive face of one who knows the games of power, but behind his attentive eyes lies an unspoken challenge: here nothing is gained by sympathy. Votes, in this compact bloc, are not collected with a handshake. You must insinuate yourself into the cracks of consensus, speak where others impose, listen where others preach.

But beware: even the purest faith can burn those who wield it with too much ambition.\n",

  "spanish_alliance_mission_1_input": "Cardinal Diego López de Ayala is one of the most influential in the Spanish faction. He is a traditionalist, but his recent letters speak of disillusionment. You meet him in the inner cloister, as he leafs through an ancient copy of the Regula Benedicti. “Our candidate's hands are too tied to the past,” he confides. “But you... you are too young. What guarantees me that you won't be another Medici, in disguise?” You have little time to convince him. Tell him about your spiritual vision, show him compromising documents about another candidate, or offer him a position in the future Curia.\n",
  "spanish_alliance_mission_1": "In the muffled silence of the inner cloister, Cardinal Diego López de Ayala barely glances up from the manuscript he holds in his hands. His face is gaunt, marked by years of obedience and disillusionment. “Our candidate looks to the past,” he murmurs, “but you... you are just a new face. Nothing more.” The weight of his words presses like stone. But you don't take the easy path: you offer no promises, no appointments. You stand before him, with a steady voice and an open heart. You speak of a Church returning to its essence, of a renewal born not of power, but of faith. You quote the Scriptures, the Fathers, the urgent need for a return to spiritual truth, stripped of gold and calculation. He slowly closes the book. He watches you. Something in his eyes changes, but it's too soon to know if it will be enough. Now only one thing matters: will your faith be deep enough to move his?\nFaith Test: roll the dice to convince Cardinal Ayala.\n",

After long votes and whispers behind ancient wooden stalls, the decision has come: you have been elected Pontiff, spiritual guide of over a billion faithful. The Throne of Peter is now yours. The Master of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations approaches and whispers to you: “Sanctitas tua, what do you wish to be called?” Choose a name. Perhaps a tribute to the saints. Perhaps a sign of rupture. But now you are no longer just a man. You are the Vicar of Christ. You don the white papal vestment. You look at yourself one last time in the mirror, but the man reflected is no longer you: it is the Pope. The Cardinal Protodeacon appears on the central balcony and announces: “Habemus Papam!” The square erupts in a roar of jubilation. Bells. Tears. Faith renewed. You have won. Not just the game. You have conquered the heart of the Church. The world now watches you. Every word, every gesture will be history. But only the beginning of the pontificate. May God guide you... Your Holiness.\n",
